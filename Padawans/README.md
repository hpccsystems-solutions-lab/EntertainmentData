# ECL Jedi Code Challenge

Welcome Padawans to the ECL Jedi Workshop!

In this 3-hour workshop, you will be introduced to big data concepts, how to process and analyze data using ECL (Enterprise Control Language). 
This challenge starts with an overview of ECL language and its syntax. Then we will explore a series of code challenges ranging from easy to mid-level difficulty to solve.

Are you ready for the challenge? Let's get started! 

## Data Sources (Datasets)
We will be using the Star Wars Character Dataset in this workshop. There is a lot to explore! 
 
## Challenge 
We will use the power of ECL to understand the characters better. 

Examples:

Who is the largest character?

Who has appeared in the most movies?

How many Male Characters, how many female?

...and a lot more!
