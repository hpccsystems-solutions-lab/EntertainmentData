# Thank You Code Sharks for Attending Code Sharks 2

This folder contains the suggested solutions to your challenge.

We will keep the Training Cluster open until the evening of November 12th. 
You can always download and copy the data and any other data and code to the 24/7 public cluster available to you here:

You can also look at creating your own cluster! Check out the documentation for creating a localized container cluster using Docker Desktop and Kubernetes:

Thank you again for attending! Hope to see you again next year!
